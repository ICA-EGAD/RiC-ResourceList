Cette migration a coïncidé avec la mise en ligne d’un nouveau portail de ses collections basé sur les principes des données ouvertes liées (Linked Open Data). Après deux ans d’implémentation, la Fondation a souhaité tirer un premier bilan afin que son expérience puisse servir aux institutions qui souhaiteraient suivre le même chemin.

2,RiC-O Converter: A Software to Convert EAC-CPF and EAD 2002 XML Files to RDF Datasets Conforming to Records in Contexts Ontology,Florence Clavaud | Thomas Francart | Pauline Charbonnier,"RiC-O Converter is an open source command-line tool to convert EAD finding aids and EAC-CPF authority records to RDF files conforming to ICA Records in Contexts ontology (RiC-O) in a robust manner. It was developed for the Archives nationales of France but is aimed to be reused by other archival institutions, and to this aim is fully documented in English. It is based on XSLT stylesheets that consider the variability of EAD content. It enabled the Archives nationales of France to convert 15,400 EAC-CPF files and 31,000 EAD files into a homogeneous knowledge graph, and to start a more specific project aiming to provide end users with an intuitive search interface for a significant subset of this graph, opening new perspectives for navigating and linking from/to archival metadata.

3,Extending RiC-O to Model Historical Architectural Archives: The ITDT Ontology,Daria Mikhaylova | Daniele Mettili,"Historical architectural archives enjoy attention from diverse audiences, acting as a primary source of information for architects, historians, public authorities, and common citizens alike. In Italy, the interest in architectural archives has grown slowly but steadily for the last 20 years. However, architectural archives do not generally follow the trend common for museums and galleries in publishing digitized materials and providing standard metadata for individual records. The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities. We discuss the application of the ontology to the project files of Italian architect and engineer Dino Tamburini (1924–2011), and the creation of a digital archive offering multiple perspectives over the records.

It provides a quick overview of the RiC Conceptual Model and then focuses on RiC-O, its design principles and content and giving references to more precise documentation that is publicly available online. Finally, it presents the roadmap and future perspectives of RiC.

The main challenge of the project was to provide users with a relevant and accessible research interface to explore an archival metadata graph of significant size, which exploits its nature.Through this prototype, built with Sparnatural, you can query a knowledge graph created from a part of the metadata describing the archives of Paris notaries kept at the French national Archives. These metadata have been semantized according to the ontology Records In Contexts (RiC-O). The prototype is composed of two research interfaces. Interface A offers a simple and general exploration interface in this metadata, which could be used for other archival metadata. Interface B offers an exploration interface in these metadata based on the specificities of notarial archives.

It aimed to teach archival description subjects to his BA students and link results using the Records in Contexts (RIC) standard, RDF Turtle standard, and a graph database. The exercise spanned five weeks, during which students had to create the archival description of an exemplary records aggregation of notable historian Jaroslav Šidak, provided by the Faculty Archives. This exercise aimed to examine the potential of RIC and linked data technologies to facilitate collaboration among archivists, reduce the description-related work through decentralization, enable re-using and linking descriptions, and visualize results. The author offers a conclusion regarding collaborative work and creating new knowledge from archived heritage. Finally, some further directions regarding these subjects are being proposed.",2024-10,article,https://doi.org/10.54356/MA/2024/JVGE4567,English | Croatian (title and abstract),,RiC-O 1.0,,,
