        <li><p>Master's thesis. From the abstract: The art record is the totality of records produced and accumulated in the course of artistic activity, from creation to appreciation, and to fully understand it, we must not focus on individual records, but on the people, organisations, events, and relationships with other records to which they relate. This contextual information is essential to understanding not only the circumstances under which a record was produced, but also its intent, purpose, and value. The Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art selects, collects, preserves, and researches Korean contemporary art records and materials, and provides art records to users through various contents. However, the current search service of the Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art has limitations in reflecting the contextual information of art records or providing them systematically. In this study,  we aimed to devise a method for providing contextual information in the search service of the Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art based on RiC-O.</p>
